 :rocket: Joined this game in September 2022, definitely loving it!

:hearts: Why didn't I start earlier?? As a new enthusiast of web development, I'm thirsty for knowledge, and I try to improve a little more every day!

ðŸŒ± Currently learning React, Node, Docker. 

ðŸ’¬ I am 29 years old, passionate about travel, and used to travel a lot. Therefore, I worked in tourism, among other things... Today, I am adding a new passion to my repertoire: web development. Can't wait to go further and see where it brings me âš¡
